Tutorials
=========

.. for now I put all notebooks of documentation to notebooks folder, making a copy of the original
    in progetti/pySurf folder will clean later

    I am using pointed list everywhere because I have not clear how toctree works. 

.. TODO: these files in _static etc. are not compiled, so ipynb are not tested.

.. TODO: some of the notebooks have been copied by source in _static or notebooks folder. The first are compiled, but are not in synch with the source.

Introductory docs
-------------------------------

A few introductory presentations to give an overall view of purposes and functionalities:

* Poster (SPIE 2023, San Diego) `pdf <../_static/vcotroneo_SPIE2023.pdf>`_
* `Presentation <../_static/profile_demo_rise.slides.html>`_, created from Jupyter notebook (NSFE NanoScientific Forum 2020)  `pdf <../_static/profile_demo_rise.slides.pdf>`_ :download:`download source <../_static/profile_demo_rise.ipynb>`
*  Gallery: Examples of different interfaces TODO üõ†Ô∏è 


Examples
--------

These Jupyter notebooks illustrate practical examples on how to start or to perform specific operations.  

*   `Introduction to the library <../notebooks/pySurf_demo.ipynb>`_ :download:`download source <../notebooks/pySurf_demo.ipynb>`

*  `Usage <../notebooks/basic_usage.ipynb>`_ :download:`download source <../notebooks/basic_usage.ipynb>`

Advanced Examples
-----------------

Some example from real life, TODO üõ†Ô∏è 

`Example of interactive alignment <../_static/rotate and align.html>`_

Example of class ``Profile``, 1D analogous of ``Data2D``:

`Profile Tutorial <../_static/Profile_class_tutorial.html>`_  :download:`download source <../_static/Profile_class_tutorial.ipynb>`

`Analysis of PSD and Merging tests <../_static/test_merge_P01.html>`_ `pdf <../_static/test_merge_P01.slides.pdf>`_ :download:`download source <../_static/test_merge_P01.ipynb>`

Where to find more
-------------------

More examples and tests can be found scattered in subfolders of source code repository, see also `Developer Notes <readmedev_link.rst>`_.

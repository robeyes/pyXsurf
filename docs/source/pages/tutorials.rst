Tutorials
=========

.. for now I put all notebooks of documentation to notebooks folder, making a copy of the original
    in progetti/pySurf folder will clean later

    I am using pointed list everywhere because I have not clear how toctree works. 

A few introductory presentations to give an overall view of purposes and functionalities:

* `ion (Poster at SPIE San Diego 2023) <../_static/vcotroneo_SPIE2023.pdf>`_
* `Introduction (Poster at SPIE San Diego 2023) <../_static/vcotroneo_SPIE2023.pdf>`_
* Gallery: Examples of different interfaces üõ†Ô∏è 


These examples (Jupyter notebooks) illustrate practical examples on how to start or to perform specific operations.  

*  Introduction to the library `view <../notebooks/pySurf_demo.ipynb>`_  :download:`download <../notebooks/pySurf_demo.ipynb>`

*  `Usage üõ†Ô∏è <../notebooks/basic_usage.ipynb>`_
*  `Profiles Examples <profiles.rst>`_

More examples and tests can be found scattered in subfolders of source code repository, see also `Developer Notes <readmedev_link.rst>`_.

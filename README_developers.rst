Developers Notes
------------
2021/07/21
Really trying to improve installation and release.
Mostly following https://medium.com/free-code-camp/from-a-python-project-to-an-open-source-package-an-a-to-z-guide-c34cb7139a22

and based on astropy template.

This is a good page explaining the basic usage of ``git`` 
https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/routine.html

if you are not sure of what you are doing (as I am most of the time), feel free to keep it locally and use only ``git`` or to use any expertise you have (and I don't necessarily do have).
